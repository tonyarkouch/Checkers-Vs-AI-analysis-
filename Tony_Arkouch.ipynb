        "Parameters:\n",
        "player: The identifier for the player (either \"1\" or \"2\").\n",
        "depth: The maximum depth of the search tree to explore.\n",
        "maximizing: A boolean indicating if the current recursion level is trying to maximize or minimize the evaluation score.\n",
        "Purpose: To find the optimal move for the current player considering future possible moves by both players up to a specified depth.\n",
        "Returns: A tuple containing the best evaluation score from the current state and the best move to achieve that score.\n",
        "Step-by-Step Explanation\n",
        "Base Case\n",
        "If depth is 0, the function returns the current board evaluation (by calling evaluate_board()) and None for the move. This indicates that the recursion has reached its maximum depth, and it's time to assess the board state from the perspective of the maximizing player without further moves.\n",
        "Recursive Case\n",
        "The function operates differently based on the maximizing flag:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Maximizing Player\n",
        "Initialize max_eval to negative infinity to ensure any actual score evaluated is higher. This is because the maximizing player seeks to maximize the score.\n",
        "Iterate over all valid moves for the player using get_valid_moves(player).\n",
        "For each move:\n",
        "Execute the move by calling evaluate_click(*move).\n",
        "Recursively call minimax with depth-1 and maximizing set to False, indicating it's now the minimizing player's turn.\n",
        "After the recursive call, undo the move with undo_move(*move) to restore the board to its previous state.\n",
        "Compare the evaluation score returned by the recursive call to max_eval. If it's greater, update max_eval and record this move as best_move.\n",
        "Return max_eval and best_move, representing the best possible outcome from this point for the maximizing player and the move to achieve it.\n",
        "2. Minimizing Player\n",
        "Initialize min_eval to positive infinity, as the minimizing player seeks to minimize the score.\n",
        "Similar to the maximizing player, iterate over all valid moves:\n",
        "Perform each move and call minimax recursively with depth-1 and maximizing set to True, switching back to maximizing player's perspective.\n",
        "Undo each move to not affect the ongoing game state.\n",
        "If the recursive call returns a score less than min_eval, update min_eval and best_move to reflect the most disadvantageous outcome for the opponent (advantageous for the minimizing player).\n",

        "BFS\n",
        "\n",
        "Overview\n",
        "Purpose: To identify the best move for the specified player using a breadth-first search approach.\n",
        "Parameters:\n",
        "player: The player number (\"1\" or \"2\"), indicating whose move it is.\n",
        "Returns: A boolean indicating whether a move was made (True) or if no valid move was found (False).\n",
        "Function Execution\n",
        "Initialization\n",
        "Queue Initialization: The function starts by initializing a queue using deque with a tuple containing the current board state and an empty path list. The path will store the sequence of moves leading to each board state.\n",
        "Seen States: A set called seen_states is created to keep track of the board configurations that have already been explored. This prevents the algorithm from revisiting the same board state multiple times and ensures efficiency.\n",
        "BFS Loop\n",
        "Queue Processing: The function enters a loop that continues until the queue is empty. This loop processes each board configuration in a breadth-first manner.\n",
        "Dequeue Operation: The first element (board and path) is popped from the queue.\n",
        "Path Check: If the path length is greater than 1, the current board is skipped. This is a constraint to limit the search depth to one move ahead only, simplifying the BFS to focus only on immediate possible moves.\n",
        "Move Exploration\n",
        "Valid Moves: For the current board state, all valid moves for the player are determined using get_valid_moves(player).\n",
        "Move Execution:\n",
        "For each move, a copy of the current board (new_board) is created to simulate the move without altering the actual game board.\n",
        "The move is executed on this new board using evaluate_click(*move).\n",
        "State Tracking:\n",
        "After a move is executed, the resulting board configuration is converted into a tuple (board_tuple), which is a hashable format suitable for tracking in a set.\n",
        "If this board state has not been seen before, it is added to seen_states.\n",
        "The new board state, along with the path updated to include the current move, is enqueued for further exploration.\n",
        "Best Move Selection\n",
        "Best Move Execution: If a valid move is found (i.e., best_move is not None), the function executes this move on the actual game board using evaluate_click(*best_move).\n",
        "Return Value: The function returns True if a move was executed, indicating a successful action. If the queue is exhausted without finding a valid move, it returns False.\n",
        "\n",
        "Greedy\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose: Finds and executes the move that offers the most immediate advantage in terms of piece count differential for the given player.\n",

        "player: A string (\"1\" or \"2\") representing which player's turn it is.\n",
        "Returns: A boolean indicating whether a move was made (True) or if no advantageous move was found (False).\n",
        "Detailed Step-by-Step Logic\n",
        "Initialization\n",
        "Best Move Tracking: Initialize best_move to None. This variable will store the move that provides the highest immediate gain in terms of piece count differential.\n",
        "Maximum Difference Initialization: Initialize max_piece_diff to negative infinity (float('-inf')). This variable keeps track of the highest piece differential found among all evaluated moves.\n",
        "Move Evaluation Loop\n",
        "Valid Moves Enumeration: Iterate through all valid moves available to the player using the get_valid_moves(player) function.\n",
        "Move Execution: For each move (from_x, from_y, to_x, to_y), temporarily execute the move on the board by calling evaluate_click(from_x, from_y, to_x, to_y).\n",
        "Board Evaluation\n",
        "Evaluate Board: After executing the move, evaluate the current board state by calling evaluate_board(), which calculates the difference in the number of pieces between the two players.\n",
        "Undo Move: Immediately undo the move using undo_move(from_x, from_y, to_x, to_y) to restore the board to its original state before the move was made.\n",
        "Greedy Selection\n",
        "Update Best Move: If the piece differential obtained from evaluate_board() is greater than the current max_piece_diff, update max_piece_diff with the new differential and best_move with the current move. This ensures that the function always selects the move that maximizes the immediate gain.\n",
        "Execute Best Move\n",
        "Perform Best Move: After evaluating all possible moves, check if a best_move has been found. If so, execute this move permanently on the board by calling evaluate_click(*best_move).\n",
